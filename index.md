## About Me 



Hi, there! My name is Effie. Welcome to my website. I would like to share some of my interesting projects and little things about data analytics with you. 

I just graduated from M.S. in Statistics program at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) in May 2020 and I gained my B.S. in Statistics from the same school in May 2018. Currently, I am a Decision Scientist at [Global Lending Services LLC](https://glsauto.com/). Our team is responsible for developing advanced credit risk models, analytical methods, and tools for risk montorning, decisioning and management. 

I am enthusiastic about analyzing data and telling stories behind numbers. Statistical modeling and programming are my favorite subjects in the data analysis process. I specialize in regression analysis and classification problems. To know more about my professional facts, please check out my **[resum√©](https://github.com/xiranwang7/My-Website/raw/master/XiranWang_Resume_.pdf)**.
