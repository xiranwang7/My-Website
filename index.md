Hi, there! my name is Xiran. Welcome to my website. 

I just graduated from M.S. in Statsitics program at [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/) in May, 2020 and I gained my B.S. in Statistics from the same school in May, 2018. Yasss, **GAMECOCKS** fowever!! 

I am enthusiastic about analyzing data and telling stories behind numbers. Statistical modeling and programming are my favorite part in data analysis process. Especially, I am specialized at regression analysis and classification problems.
 
In my leisure time, I like wroking out and spending time outdoors to enjoy eveything about the nature. I love different cultures and I want to travel around the world to see, to feel and to undersatnd them.
